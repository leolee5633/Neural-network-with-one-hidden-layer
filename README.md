# Neural-network-with-one-hidden-layer
In this repo, I will learn how to:

+ Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
+ Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
+ Compute the cross entropy loss
+ Implement forward and backward propagation

# 1-Packages
Let's first import all the packages that you will need during this assignment.

+ [numpy](https://hub.coursera-notebooks.org/user/hbyfoqdzcnvtipsgmqsael/notebooks/Week%203/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer/www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
+ [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
+ [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a library for plotting graphs in Python.
+ testCases provides some test examples to assess the correctness of your functions
+ planar_utils provide various useful functions used in this assignment
